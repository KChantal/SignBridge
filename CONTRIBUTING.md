# Contributing to SignBridge

Thank you for checking out SignBridge!

This project is currently no longer **accepting external contributions** 🚧

It’s publicly visible because I believe in the spirit of building great things in the open — and in order to welcome any thoughtful ideas and feedback from the developer community 🎨  
(See below for more on this)

🏗️

SignBridge is still in the early stages of development and ideation. I’m currently conducting user research, and actively collaborating with members of the D/deaf and hard-of-hearing community to ensure the product is built _with_ and _for_ its core users.

This means feature direction, technical decisions, and community input are being shaped carefully, based on real needs — not assumptions.

👥

If you’re a developer, designer, researcher, or someone with relevant insight and a genuine interest in the mission, your ideas and feedback are very welcome! 💡

Please feel free to open an issue or get in touch!

– K.
