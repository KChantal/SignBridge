# SignBridge

## Speech or Text to Transcription and/or AI-generated Sign Language Video

**Building Bridges for Inclusive Communication**

SignBridge is an early-stage project being developed in close collaboration with members of the D/deaf and hard-of-hearing community.

With key focus on accessibility, real usability, inclusion, and true, lived experience at the very heart of the process, and a vital part of any development of the app.

Feedback and ideas are welcome - please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

_Currently focused on support for British English/BSL (British Sign Language), with plans to expand to, and support, ASL, and additional sign languages in the future_

### Project goals:

- Mobile application that converts speech or text into accessible formats - including text output and, as a current stretch goal, AI-generated BSL videos (with further language support to follow)
- Support for real-time transcription assisting in everyday interactions (e.g. in-person conversations, phone calls, and more)
