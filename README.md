# SignBridge

## Speech or Text to Transcription and/or AI-generated Sign Language Video

**Building Bridges for Inclusive Communication**

SignBridge is an early-stage project being developed in close collaboration with members of the D/deaf and hard-of-hearing community. From day one, the focus is on accessibility, real usability, and inclusion — with true, lived experience at the very heart of the process, and a vital part of all development.

Feedback and ideas are welcome — please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more.

_Currently focused on support for BSL (British Sign Language), with plans to expand to, and support, ASL, and additional sign languages in the future_

### Project goals:

- A mobile-first tool that converts speech or text into accessible formats — including text output and, optionally, AI-generated BSL videos (with further language support to follow)
- Support for real-time transcription assisting in everyday interactions (e.g. in-person conversations, phone calls, and more)
